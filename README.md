#Instructions for Assembly

Honestly, the silkscreen is easy enough to follow. If you follow the markings, it'll go together correctly. These are just some steps for ease of assembly (order of operations). Keep in mind I'm going to use both simple descriptive terms as well as actual part names so it can serve all skill levels.

1. Organize all of your parts and ensure you have everything to get started. (As shown)

2. Start with the voltage regulator (black square with 3 pins). Line it up on the white box (the pins can only go one way) and then flip the entire assembly over and solder the pins on the back. It's helpful to put a little weight on the board so the component is flush when soldering.

3. Once that is done, grab the jumper header pin (the little fork looking pin and solder that with the long legs facing UP. It is labled JP1 on the PCB. I put the jumper on it as it goes so you know what it looks like.

4. Time to install the long header pins to the PCB. I found it helpful to have the WT32 module plugged in to the header pins to keep them straight while soldering. The small pins are going to come from the BOTTOM of the PCB and be soldered on the top.

When that step is done, your board will look like this:

5. Time for the wiring connectors. I found it easiest to push them through the top and flip the entire assembly over and put some weight on the top. (your solder spool works great for this). Solder all 4 of these connectors.

6. Now solder the 4 fuse holders. Some helping hands are great for this part, but if you just have yourself. I found pinching the board and the component together while tacking one of the pins on was easiest.

6. With the 4 fuse holders copmlete, Solder on the Voltage + Ground connector. Again, helping hands or the pinch method will serve you well.

Your board should now look like this:

Insert your fuses and give it a try. The finished project (in a stylish case) will look like this:
